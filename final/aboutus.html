        <h1>About us...</h1>
        <h5>When our CEO's interest in teeth gems and whitening grew, she embarked on her journey in January 2021. She was captivated by the concept of permanent teeth jewelry and trained under Tooth Kandy, the original tooth gem company based out of Los Angeles, California. This company has collaborated with celebrities such as Ariana Grande and Bretman Rock. This company carries the largest selection of tooth gems in the United States of America. If you would like to check out Tooth Kandys products and services click on this <a href="https://www.toothkandy.com/">link here!</a></h5>
        <h5>Although the coronavirus was still present, the CEO of Icy Teeth continued to practice, learn, and take virtual lessons with instructors at Tooth Kandy until she was confident to take on clients. Our CEO obtained her completion certificate and soon after opened a shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</h5>
        <h5>We are enthusiasts of teeth jewelry and take pride in the services we provide here at Icy Teeth. Our journey has only just begun, and what began as a hobby has now grown into a full-fledged enterprise.
